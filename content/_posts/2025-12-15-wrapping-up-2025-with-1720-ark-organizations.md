2025 has been a great year for the ARK Alliance (ARKA). With 247 new organizations registered so far, the total number of ARK organizations stands at 1720\. That includes:

* 12 national libraries,
* 215 universities,
* 254 archives,
* 144 museums,
* 124 journals, and
* 59 scientific centers.

Some highlights for 2025:

* Implementors are welcome to add the ARK logo to their sites and collections, linking back to arks.org. The logo, with transparent (cut out) background, is available to be copied (e.g., right-click and "Save image as") in PNG or SVG format:
<div class="row" align="center" markdown=1>
![][arklogopng]{: .img-thumbnail .img-responsive fetchpriority="high" loading="eager" height="140" width="140"}
{: .col }
<div class="col" markdown=1>
![][arklogosvg]{: .img-thumbnail .img-responsive fetchpriority="high" loading="eager" height="140" width="140"}
</div>
</div>
* ARK tutorials have been given at conferences including IIIF, Europeana Pro, DCMI, iPRES, SWIB, and Fedora Virtual Showcase, with two new videos added to the [ARKA youtube channel](https://youtube.com/@arks_org) and a French-language tutorial presented in Dakar ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1V7_AnsRiE3X6SSdQnq-2NYDosjp1u2u-Vqp8Lp8YX7Y/edit?usp=sharing)).  
* In July a new NAAN request form was deployed that helps us build a richer picture of ARK usage, along with a new streamlined backend request processing workflow.  
* In October the [classic-to-modern ARK document conversion](https://arks.org/news/2025-07-28-documentation-change-from-classic-to-modern-arks/) was completed and inflection support for metadata (e.g., “?info” suffix) was added to the refreshed global ARK resolver based at N2T.net.   
* In November we hosted a lively open community call with lots of new faces (48 attendees) and short talks from the ARK Alliance, California Digital Library, FamilySearch, and the West and Central African Research and Education Network (WACREN) ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11BLct_FhQIl9jgaFPfpisclrYcjtbYOmhIia9XHDIeo/edit?usp=sharing)). This will be part of an ongoing series of community calls.  
* Since our last community update, three new volunteers were approved for ARKA working groups: Josefrank Pernalete, Editorial Mar Caribe; Cécile Queffélec, BnF (National Library of France); and Gabriel Silveira Marques, Brazilian Institute of Information in Science. 

As a reminder we are always open to new [working group](https://arks.org/community-groups/) members for Outreach (presentations, document translation, etc.), NAAN curation (request processing), and Technical (software, specifications, support). If you wish to volunteer, please express your interest by filling out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/15bhmP5Z0aOLaTWfXKK0TBTJCOAXuT30hIzfhij-D_oM).

Thank you for supporting ARKA and best wishes for 2026\!
